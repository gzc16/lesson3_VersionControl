## Project Description:
The purpose of this assignment is to assess the importance of version control and how we can be effective about version control which is where 
Git comes into play. GitHub is a site that allows developers to save files in a repository and thus, allows developers to exercise good version
control.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. SYNTAX IS VERY IMPORTANT. The interactive sites and in-class exercises were especially effective in teaching me this because error messages would
appear and I was not sure why or how to fix them. But in class and on the "Learn git in 15 minutes" site, I was told what changes needed to be made to
get the correct outcome. 
2. VERSION CONTROL IS SIMILAR TO A TIMELINE OF CHANGES. Version control systems allow developers to see each change they make as the continue developing which
is important for troubleshooting and backtracking. 
3. GIT IS NOT ONLY FOR STORAGE. In the video about version control, the speaker talks about all the advantages of using Git to do so and all of capabilities Git users have.
