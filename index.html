            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is the storage system being used in this course. I honestly did not know much about 
            Git prior to coming into this class so this section was really intriguing and informative. From the reading
            I learned what Git exactly is and its origin. Git "was born" in 2005 and since then it has gotten faster and
            more efficient. Git, however, was created from the remains of an old system called BitKeeper. The Linux kernel
            was the jumping-off point for Git and was around from 1991-2002. The relationship that existed between those that
            cultivated the Linux kernel and the team that cultivated BitKeeper deteriorated and thus, BitKeeper being free 
            did not last much longer. It was at that time Git was starting to develop and was finished in 2005. Since then, 
            people like us have been using Git to aid them in web development.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This site was interactive and allows users to play around with some basic Git commands such as revert,
            commit, and push. For me, this was especially helpful because I am a visual learner. Being able to see the reaction each
            action produces was really cool! The basic concepts of Git are featured which is optimal for this class. I concentrated 
            mostly on commit and push because in class, we discussed that commit and push are 2 out of the 3 commands we must 
            absolutely know. I really enjoy how the different commands are sorted for even more ease navigating through the site!</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The title of this assignment is version control. What exactly does version control mean? This video is a great
            resource for learning version control 101. It's nice and short but also hits all the major need-to-know points of version control.
            In short, version control is keeping track of changes made throughout cultivating a file so if there are errors or the developer 
            needs to go back and look into the history of the file then they can do so with ease. This is what we use Git for. As previously 
            mentioned in the blurb about the history of Git, Git has become so fast and efficient for developers and is an excellent tool to 
            use for version control! </p>

            <p class="lead">Of the two interactive Git sites, I prefer this one because this one gives you a little bit more information about 
            what each command means and the importance of the syntax. Also, this one is better because it shows you not only what the commands 
            and their reactions look like in the terminal but also what it physically looks like in the repository which is a bonus! Again, I 
            am a visual learner so this was a great resource and super effective in walking me through Git. This is excellent for beginners also 
            beacsue it tells you what error messages appear when something isn't done correctly and it also gives you the correction that needs to 
            be made to produce the correct result. </p>
